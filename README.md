  - Create a private repository "Programacion_Aplicada" and add GerardoMunoz-UD as a collaborator
  - Log in at your personal Colab account    
  - Copy in your Colab account the [Language Basics Jupyter](https://github.com/GerardoMunoz/Curso_Python/blob/main/PA_01_Elementos_del_lenguaje.ipynb) and add a cell at the top with your personal information and links to each section of the same Jupyter.
  - Save this Jupyter in the GitHub account

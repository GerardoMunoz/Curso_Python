* Add Two Vectors: Write a function that takes two vectors (each represented as a list of numbers) as input and returns their element-wise sum. For example, given the vectors [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6], the function should return [5, 7, 9].

* Multiply Two Matrices: Write a function that takes two matrices (each represented as a list of lists of numbers) as input and returns their matrix product. For example, given the matrices [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and [[5, 6], [7, 8]], the function should return [[19, 22], [43, 50]].

* Generate Fibonacci Series: Write a function that takes an integer ùëõ as input and returns the first ùëõ numbers of the Fibonacci series. For example, if n=5, the function should return [0, 1, 1, 2, 3].

* Calculate Vector Norm: Write a function that takes a vector (represented as a list of numbers) as input and returns its Euclidean norm (also known as the magnitude or length of the vector). For example, given the vector [3, 4], the function should return 5.0.

* Calculate Standard Deviation: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their standard deviation, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the numbers. For example, given the list [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9], the function should return approximately 2.0.

* Subtract Two Vectors: Write a function that takes two vectors (each represented as a list of numbers) as input and returns their element-wise difference. For example, given the vectors [4, 5, 6] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [3, 3, 3].

* Transpose a Matrix: Write a function that takes a matrix (represented as a list of lists of numbers) as input and returns its transpose. For example, given the matrix [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], the function should return [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]].

* Dot Product of Two Vectors: Write a function that takes two vectors (each represented as a list of numbers) as input and returns their dot product. For example, given the vectors [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6], the function should return 32.

* Calculate Variance: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their variance, which measures the spread between numbers in the list. For example, given the list [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9], the function should return approximately 4.0.

* Calculate Mean: Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their mean (average). For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the function should return 3.0.

* Diagonal Matrix: Check that a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãdiagonal.
